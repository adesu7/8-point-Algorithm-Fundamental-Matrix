# Fundamental Matrix calculation
Manual Implementation of 8 point algorithm to compute a Fundamental Matrix
a. Shifted and scaled the pixel coordinates
b. Compute the design matrix from sets of (at least) 8 points using SIFT keypoints
c. Performed an SVD of the design matrix to find its null space (you can use a
library function for the SVD)
d. Composed the draft fundamental matrix F
e. Performed an SVD of the draft fundamental matrix, set the smallest singular
value to zero and reassemble so that F now has determinant = 0
f. Calculated which correspondences are inliers and which are outliers using this
F. Accounted for some error because the keypoint coordinates wonâ€™t lie exactly on the epipolar line and took into account any
scaling you applied at step a.
g. Wrapped the steps b-f in a RANSAC loop that runs enough times to have a probability > 99% of finding 8 inliers and computing a good quality F.
h. Re-estimated F using all the inliers.
i. Compute F in terms of the original pixel coordinates (ie undo the effects of (step a).
